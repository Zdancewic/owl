Owl is a modified version of the [utop](https://github.com/diml/utop)
package, with simplified features and default libraries that
are geared toward novice programmers.

The main differences from utop are:

* owl provides simpler default settings and exposes fewer libraries
* owl wraps some of the OCaml libraries to make them more accessible
* owl comes bundled with some modules designed for learning about
  programming
